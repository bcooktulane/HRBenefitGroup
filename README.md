Project
---------------------
A business advisory firm based out of Omaha, Nebraska needed a responsive website completed quickly to capitalize on small businesses looking to enroll in the Insurance Marketplace created under Obamacare. 

Tools and Technologies Used
------------------------------------
[Webflow](http://webflow.com): Responsive web design tool based around Bootstrap 2 grid system. Webflow helped me create a responsive design quickly and provided me with production-ready code that I could further modify.

Amazon EC2: I wanted to give the client a live preview of the design in an environment that was not local. Using an Amazon EC2 instance allowed me quickly give them a preview and make changes on the fly.
